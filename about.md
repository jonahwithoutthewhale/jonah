### The Primary Tribe
We are an awesomely awkward little tribe of three very different people with very different interests. Animals, technology, the earth, gaming, sports, spirituality, privacy... these are just a few of the topics we daydream about, research, and discuss with others. From dinner party conversations to hair salon chair talk, we find ourselves in these conversations. The thing is, these topics literally make the world a better place. The more we share about the good shit* we have learned, the more we may influence others to do good shit too. And the world could really use all of us doing more good shit!

Why Jonah without the Whale? We have a Jonah who is 11. But unlike Jonah in the Bible, you won’t end up in the belly of a whale if you don’t listen to what we are preaching... because the whales will all be dead, the oceans will be polluted, a cyber attack will have already turned the bots against us, but the Patriots will still be going to the Super Bowl. So, just go do good shit because simple things will make you healthier and happier, make your family safer, and protect the planet and her resources.

 * This is a PG-13 blog. The word shit may be used frequently.
