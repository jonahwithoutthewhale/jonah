In this time of grief, of sorrow, of endless patience and bad news, we need some healing of ourselves. As you know if you read my description, I am Jewish. One of the songs we learned is about just what we need now, peace. I am attaching this video, and I hope it brings hope for you. I also included the words in English.

Peace will come upon us
Peace will come upon us
Peace will come upon us
and on everyone.

*Peace*
On us and on everyone
Peace, Peace
