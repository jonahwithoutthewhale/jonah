I am _really_ not good about remembering birthdays and anniversaries. It is honestly not a reflection of how much I love the person, I really just have a block about remembering dates. So it seems reasonable that I would not remember the date, or even a specific event, that ignited what has become the purpose to my life.

Protecting the earth and her resources.

Advocating for the protection of animals.

Sharing my experience that my connection to the earth, her resources, and to the animals healed the hurt parts.

Where does one start? This would seem overwhelming if I hadn't already confessed that I don't remember when or where it all started. I can assure you there are no prerequisites or pre-qualifications; I wouldn't have passed had there been. I also know it is a process, a constant evolution. One of my hesitations about sharing on this blog is I know I don't have it all figured out and I don't always get it right. But then I realized that actually gives me more credibility. I say f%#@ way too much, I have parenting fails, I have been known to have road rage, I have strained relationships and everyday I start with burning palo santo, lighting a candle, sitting in meditation, and journaling my gratitudes to connect with Source and begin again.

If you cultivate a curiosity about the earth and your connection to it, become aware of what you consume from food to technology and observe your emotional responses, it will flow into a natural introduction to all sorts of ideas, information, and ways of being. Then your reality softly shifts into a new way of being where there is more joy and ease. What I absolutely know is if there is any struggle, then it is not the way.
