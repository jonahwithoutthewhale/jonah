**Directions**
1. Cook pasta according to instructions on box. Rinse and put aside. 

2. Heat oil over medium heat.

3. Add onion and pepper. Pinch of salt or to taste. Sauté until onion is translucent and pepper is bright in color. If in doubt, less is more. Don’t cook all the nutrients out of your food.

4. Add as much gardein as you like for a meaty flavor and the minced garlic to the onion and green pepper.  Sauté for 3 minutes! You should be able to see the difference between the frozen and cooked gardein. Do not over-cook it. If you're concerned about your soy intake, another great option is [Quorn Meatless Ground](https://www.quorn.us/products/quorn-meatless-grounds). However, Quorn includes egg so using Quorn would make this meal vegetarian rather than vegan.

5. Add the cooked pasta to the "meat" and veggies. Pour Rao's sauce over the whole mess to make as dry or creamy as you like. No wrong answers with this recipe! If you prefer a little more kick, try [Rao's Arrabbiata Sauce](https://www.raos.com/product/arrabbiata-sauce/).
