**Ingredients**
* 1 cup carrots, diced
* 1 cup yellow onion, diced

* 4 cups vegetable broth
* 1/2 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 2 (15.8 oz.) cans Great Northern beans, drained and rinsed

**Directions**
1. If using bouillon cubes to make the vegetable broth, boil 4 cups of water and drop in the cubes to disintegrate. We like [Knorr Vegetable Bouillon](https://www.knorr.com/us/en/products/bouillon/vegetable.html).

2. Heat a large soup pot coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat. Add carrots, onion, and garlic. Saute for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook for 5 minutes.

3. Add the broth, Italian seasoning, black pepper, and beans. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.

4. Place 2 cups of the food in a food processor of blender. Process until smooth and return the mixture to the pot. Simmer for 5 minutes.

5. Remove soup from heat. Add the spinach, stirring until it wilts. Can be served immediately.
