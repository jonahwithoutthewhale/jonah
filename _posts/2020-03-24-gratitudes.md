I had been looking for spirit cards but was having a hard time choosing what kind I wanted. Wouldn't you know, Universe took care of that for me! I am so grateful to my friend, Sandy, who sent me this beautiful deck of Medicine Wheel cards!

I LOVE that the cards capture the medicine of the Native American way and the animal kingdom!

D&#259; n&#257;ho! Wi:yo:h! _(It is said! It is good!)_

Stay tuned and I will share what I learn.
