title: "Ideas For Spending Time Inside"

I have been thinking about what I should do. I like to read but I need to find something else to do. I realized that I need to find a project that I can focus on for a long time. I think that if you have little short projects you will very quickly become disinterested. My parents were sort of interested in having a farm and I quickly came up with an idea. I decided to do research and draw out the future farm and house. I was very interested because I had the tools to make it realistic but still fun to do.

I suggest that you find something that could become a longer project for you and then try to make that happen. You can find a fun and interesting project from around your house and outside. It may seem like a pain, but you will be happy you did it. So get out there, find a project, and have fun.
