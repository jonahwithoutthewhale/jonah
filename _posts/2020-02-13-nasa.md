One night when you were just a star,

someone hung every hope, every wish, every dream,

they ever had from your limbs,

so if you ever feel inferior,

ever start to doubt your beauty or brilliance just remember:

you have constellations lining the cathedral walls of your chest,

a moon for a heart

and the sunlight pouring through your skin,

you are a symphony of stardust

and you were born to shine.
