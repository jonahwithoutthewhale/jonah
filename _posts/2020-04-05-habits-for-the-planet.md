1. Recycle.

2. Use reusable produce bags ([Biome Organic Cotton Produce Bags](https://www.biome.com.au/onya-weigh-bags/19266-biome-produce-bags-set-of-5.html)).

3. Use reusable grocery bags everywhere; not just the grocery store. _Tip: leave one in the bottom of your regular bag and leave others in your car._

4. Ditch straws ([Biome Reusable Straws](https://www.biome.com.au/module/ambjolisearch/jolisearch?search_query=straw)).

5. Use a reusable coffee mug.

6. Use shampoo bars. I use [Lush](https://www.lushusa.com/hair/shampoo-bars/) and LOVE them. I will say if you have color treated hair get a conditioning bar too.

7. Reusable snack bags; cotton ([4MyEarth Food Bag](https://www.biome.com.au/reusable-food-pouches/20180-4myearth-food-bag-purple-dandelion.html)) or paper snack bags ([Paper Snack and Sandwich Bags](https://ecowarehouse.nz/paper-snack-and-sandwich-bags-unbleached-if-you-care)). You should be able to find them at your local grocery store.

8. Bamboo utensils when you eat out ([Chico To-Go Bamboo Utensil Set](https://www.biome.com.au/sporks-all-in-one-cutlery/28197-chico-to-go-bamboo-utensil-set-green-705105479408.html)).
