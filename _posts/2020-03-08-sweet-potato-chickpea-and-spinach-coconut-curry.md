* _Prep Time:_ 25 minutes
* _Cook Time:_ 25 minutes
* _Total Time:_ 50 minutes
* _Servings:_ enough for 2 dinners for 2 adults and 1 growing child

**Ingredients**
* 4 teaspoons virgin coconut oil
* 1 Tablespoon cumin seeds
* 1 medium onion (about 2 cups)
* 3/4 to 1 teaspoon sea salt
* 3 large cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1 medium/large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/4 to 1/2 dice
* 1 (14 oz) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 1 (14 oz) diced tomatoes with juices
* 1 (14 oz) can light coconut milk
* 1 (5 oz) package baby spinach
* 1/4 teaspoon high quality curry

_For Serving:_
* Basmati rice (Uncle Ben's has a microwave version) or quinoa
* Chopped fresh cilantro leaves
* Unsweetened coconut shredded or large-flake coconut
* Lime wedge (optional)

**Directions**
1. In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and toast for about 1 minute, until fragrant and lightly darkened in color (be careful not to burn them). Immediately stir in the onion and pinch of salt, and cook 3-5 minutes.

2. Add garlic, ginger, turmeric, coriander, and red pepper flakes. Stir to combine and saute for a couple of minutes, until garlic softens.

3. Add sweet potato, chickpeas, tomatoes with their juices, and coconut milk. Stir to combine, cover, and simmer over medium heat for 20–30 minutes (until potatoes are fork-tender). Mash 1/3 to half of the mixture to thicken the sauce with a potato masher. Sprinkle in curry and stir (Rebecca’s added ingredient.)

4. Stir in spinach and cook until wilted. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.

Serve on a bed of basmati rice or quinoa, garnished with cilantro and coconut. If desired, offer with a wedge of lime to squeeze over curry.
