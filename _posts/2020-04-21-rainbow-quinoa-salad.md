**Directions**
1. **Making the salad:** Rinse the quinoa in a fine mesh sieve. Combine the quinoa, water, and a pinch of salt in a medium pot and stir. Bring to a boil over medium to high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 13-16 minutes, until the water has been absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Remove from the heat, uncover, fluff with a fork, and let cool slightly.

2. Drain and rinse the chickpeas.

3. In an extra-large bowl combine chickpeas, kale, carrot, green onion, parsley, and tomatoes.

4. **Making the red wine vinaigrette:** In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, Dijon mustard, and garlic. While whisking, slowly stream in the oil. Whisk the salt, pepper, maple syrup, and lemon zest, adjusting to taste if desired. 

5. Add the cooked quinoa to the bowl along with the veggies. Pour on all the dressing and toss well to combine. Season generously with salt and pepper.

6. I recommend adding the seeds and hemp when you eat it and not store on the leftover salad. 

Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 3 to 5 days.
