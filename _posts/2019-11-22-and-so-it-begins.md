title: "And So It Begins"

My wife and son decided that we should have a family blog. Our interests vary wildly and they think there are some nuggets in various parts of our brains that some of you out there in the interwebs might find useful. Why are we here on this planet if not to try and create some positive change? And so it begins...

I suppose the best place to start is with some introductions. Hello!

I tend to be the more technologically-minded one - I've always loved designing websites, I game and go to the movies to unwind and relax, and I follow blogs and read articles about data privacy for fun (I dare one of you to ask me about GDPR or CCPA). I was a stage manager for theater out on the west coast in a past life, but have now been working for the majority of my adult life at an investment management firm.

My wife has been a vegetarian since she was a child and has gone vegan more recently. She loves to find delicious recipes that her non-vegan friends would enjoy. Food is an integral part of how she exists in the world. She also loves animals more rhan humans. Fact. Her life goal is to someday own a farm sanctuary. She scratches that itch currently by volunteering for an animal rescue organization. Her day job is as a macro social worker (she creates social programs for those most in need).

Our son loves sports. Participating, watching, discussing... you name it. An entire part of his brain is dedicated to sports information. He also is a voracious reader, caring friend, and Magic: The Gathering player. Harry Potter and Star Wars paraphenalia can be found throughout his room (we're currently reading book 4 together and planning on watching the new Mandalorian TV show). He has been playing the piano since he was little and is studying for his bar mitzvah.

So there you have it. Three very different people with very different interests. We'll see where this little blog takes us.
