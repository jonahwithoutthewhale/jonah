**Directions**
1. Preheat a heavy bottom soup pot over medium flame. Add a splash of water, the onions, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of sea salt. Toss to coat and sweat until translucent adding, more water as needed taking care not to burn the onion.

2. Stir in the minced garlic and toss to coat. Add the sliced mushrooms, stir to combine, then cover with a lid. Sweat everything together for a few minutes until the mushrooms start to wilt.

3. Pour in the white wine then add the thyme, onion powder, black pepper, and nutritional yeast*. Continue to simmer until almost all the liquid has evaporated.

4. Sprinkle in the flour and toss to coat then add the veggie stock. Stir to mix well and use a whisk to combine well. Bring back to a simmer and cook about 10 minutes until the soup has thickened.

5. Add the coconut cream and cook one more minute or so.

6. Remove the soup from heat and add the fresh parsley and chives. Taste and adjust seasonings at this point with more sea salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes to your liking. Serve hot with extra herbs for garnish. The soup will continue to thicken as it cools down but it will thin out again upon reheating. If you prefer it thinner at this point just stir in a splash of veggie stock.

_* The nutritional yeast can be replaced with equal amounts of chickpea miso if desired and you wonâ€™t sacrifice any of the flavor. Make sure to whisk it into the veggie stock before adding it to the soup._
