title: "The Super Bowl"

Hello everyone, today I will be talking about the Super Bowl. The Patriots don’t seem the same this year, with their bad playoff performance. If you are a Patriots fan in Boston, WHO DO YOU ROOT FOR? Well, the Chiefs have only won 1 super bowl, and 3 AFL titles, but this year they have a pretty good QB, Patrick Mahomes. And then you have the 49ers, a team that struggled only a year ago, and now they’re in the Super Bowl! They have won 5 Super Bowls so don’t question them. I think the Patriots will be more embarrassed if the AFC team wins, so in my opinion you should root for the 49ers. GO 49ERS! Remember to watch the game on Sunday, 2/2 at 6:30 pm. Until next time!
