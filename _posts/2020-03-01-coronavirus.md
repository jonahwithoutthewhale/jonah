You know how your parents have probably been doing all of this preparation for the coronavirus? Well, if you look into it, you will see that almost none of the people were kids. We will be playing our video games sitting around the house all day while a lot of other people will be panicking. Even if we do get it, we will probably bounce back fast. We might not have to go to school! Yay!

For kids and grown-ups panicking out there, the coronavirus only has a 2% mortality rate. Let me compare it to the common flu. The flu has a 0.1% mortality rate. This is why some people are panicking, considering that the coronavirus' mortality rate is 1.9% higher. This is still a very low percentage, so we don't have to worry too much. It is good to prepare for what is coming, even though the coronavirus is not big in the U.S. now. So get out there, prepare, and try not to worry. We will beat the coronavirus soon!
