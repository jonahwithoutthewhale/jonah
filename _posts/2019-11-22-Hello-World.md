title: Hello, World!

My wife and son decided that we should have a family blog. Our interests vary wildly and they think there are some nuggets of gold buried in various parts of our brains that some of you out there in the interwebs might find useful. I tend to be the more technologically-minded one. I've always loved designing websites, I game and go to the movies to unwind and relax, and I follow blogs and read articles about data privacy for fun (I dare one of you to ask me about GDPR or CCPA).

My wife has been a vegetarian for most of her life and has gone vegan more recently. She loves to find delicious recipes that her non-vegan friends would enjoy. Food is an integral part of how she exists in the world. She also loves animals more rhan humans. For real. Her life goal is to someday have a farm sanctuary. She scratches that itch currently by volunteering for an animal rescue organization.

Our son loves sports. Participating, watching, discussing... you name it. An entire part of his brain is dedicated to sports information. He also is a voracious reader, caring friend, and Magic: The Gathering player. Harry Potter and Star Wars paraphenalia can be found throughout his room (we're currently reading book 4 together and planning on watching the new Mandalorian TV show). He has been playing the piano since he was little and is studying for his bar mitzvah.
