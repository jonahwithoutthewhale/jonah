I am a learner. I remember in the 6th grade I wrote a letter to Duke and NC Chapel Hill requesting a student application. This would have been 1988 when you couldn’t download information from the internet. I don’t remember wanting to study a specific topic, just that I was so eager to go to college, WHEN I WAS 12. To be honest, now I question if that story illustrates a young eager learner or a foolish idealist whose daydream REALLY exceeded her current situation.

Either way, here I am now, not a graduate of Duke or NC Chapel Hill dreaming about owning an animal sanctuary and spiritual retreat center while I work in the matrix but use my recyclable produce bags to save the earth.
