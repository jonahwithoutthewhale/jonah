Welcome to our little corner of the interwebs! I'm a self-taught web designer, having created my first of many sites in the early 90's. I run an online gaming community that's been around since 2004 with over 200 members from all over the world. I have a myriad of random passions, mostly on the technology side of the world. In the past few years, personal data privacy has been at the top of that list, which is what spawned https://privacychick.io. It's both a personal and professional interest (I spend my work hours wearing a suit [most days] in a corporate environment). I could bore you with talk of GDPR and CCPA.

I love reading. That probably sounds incredibly boring and trite, but it's true! One of my favorite things to do is curl up on the couch with a good book (a post-apocalyptic story, usually). I devour my RSS feed daily and love a smart political podcast (FiveThirtyEight, for anyone looking for a recommendation). I have a soft spot for live theater, having spent a number of years during and right out of college working as a professional stage manager. Musicals in particular. I adore Into the Woods, Rent, Wicked, and, more recently, Waitress (how can you go wrong with Sara Bareilles?!).

I learned to ski when I was four and now have the opportunity to go to the slopes with my son. I love supporting up-and-coming graphic artists on Kickstarter, because it's a skill I wish I had and there can never be too much art in the world. I dance in store aisles (to the horror of my wife), randomly spout out song lyrics, and am generally a dork. I try to be a good wife, mom, and friend. Now, I look forward to sharing some of what I know and am learning with whoever happens to stumble across us here. So, hi!
