Hello. My name is Jonah, Iâ€™m 11 years old, and I play flag football and soccer. I love family, animals, and playing sports. I also like to play around with tech. I go to private school in Cambridge. My parents are divorced, so I live in two different homes. In my blog posts, I will talk about being a kid living in two homes, current sports, funny animal stories from around our house, and living the life of a kid. I hope you enjoy our website!
